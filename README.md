This project utilized image dataset of blood smear cells which was compiled using dataset acquisition platforms such as kaggle and medical imaging platforms. The dataset contained two classes one of parasitized cells and the other uninfected cells, the iamge data was preprocessed by image preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation and rescaling. This preprocessed images were given input to convolutional layers of different deep learning models such as Custom-CNN model, pretrained models VGG-19, ResNet-101, Inception Resnet-v2, Inception-v3 for feature extraction and training. During the training process the model parameters were tuned to accurately classify the images accurately, among all the models Inception Resnet-v2 model achieved highest accuracy of 95.42% and was considered for use-case deployment.
